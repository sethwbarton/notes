# CSS for JS Developers

I'm taking this course from Joshua Comeau titled "CSS for JavaScript Developers". These are my notes from the course
separated by module. It's one of the best layed out, most thoughtful online courses I've ever seen. If you have the
opportunity to take it, do it. CSS feels like one of those pieces of web development that is used everywhere but few
people actually master it. Of course, I'd love to master it, but I'd also just love to be good enough at it that it
doesn't take a google do to the simplest of things. And, if I'm lucky, I'll learn to have fun with CSS.
