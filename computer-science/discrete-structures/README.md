# Discrete Structures

In an effort to stay sharp with the computer science know-how that was so painfully fought for during my school years,
I'm going to be doing a bit of a "rerun" of the things I learned. Discrete structures was the second CS class I ever took,
and I remember it being quite difficult at the time. It would be nice to see how much I've improved since then! And especially
nice to see how long those blasted labs take me now that I've had a few years of programming experience (and not just a single
semester). 

The class (at the time of writing) is being taught by Paul Roper. He was one of my favorites at BYU. His 
classes kicked my butt while I was there, and I hated it. Now I look back at it with appreciation because it taught me
how to be an adult the hard way. That is, if you fail to do something, there will be consequences! Luckily, his powerpoints, 
reading lists, lab descriptions - basically everything  you need to do the class besides lecture, is all on his website. I'll be following along 
there. 

The course is usually taught in C++ but I'll be doing it in TypeScript because that's what I work in and that's what I want
to be good at for the time being. Let's be honest, I'll probably never be touching C++ again unless it's to help some
student somewhere. It was a good language to get the fundamentals with because it came at you hard, but I have many more
practical concerns nowadays which I would like to address.
