# Seth Barton's Software Notes

â€‹	I've had a bit of an obsession recently for keeping track of all the things I learn. My new job has me in React, Typescript, Node, CSS, Ruby, Rails, AWS, GraphQL and a myriad of other technologies, libraries, and frameworks. I've been inhaling web development content as fast as I can but realized I need somewhere to put it. And why not put it online where others could potentially use it?

TODO: I've realized it doesn't make sense to try to cram everything I know into one repository so I should split these folders out into their own separate repositories.
